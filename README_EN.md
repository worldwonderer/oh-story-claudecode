# oh-story-claudecode

A web novel writing skill pack for Claude Code and OpenClaw. Covers the full pipeline for long-form and short-form Chinese web novels: trend scanning, deconstruction, writing, AI tone removal, and cover generation.

## Installation

**Option 1** Tell Claude Code / OpenClaw directly:

```
Install this skill https://github.com/worldwonderer/oh-story-claudecode
```

**Option 2** Command line:

```bash
npx skills add worldwonderer/oh-story-claudecode -y
```

Re-run the same command to update.

## Skills

| `story-setup` | `/story-setup` | Environment setup — deploys hooks/rules/agents/CLAUDE.md in one click |
| `story` | `/story` | Toolbox router — routes fuzzy intents to the matching skill |
| `story-long-write` | `/story-long-write` | Long-form writing — outline building, character design, prose output |
| `story-long-analyze` | `/story-long-analyze` | Long-form deconstruction — Golden First 3 Chapters, payoff design, pacing analysis |
| `story-long-scan` | `/story-long-scan` | Long-form trend scan — Qidian/Fanqie/Jinjiang market trends |
| `story-short-write` | `/story-short-write` | Short-form writing — emotion design, twist crafting, polish & delivery |
| `story-short-analyze` | `/story-short-analyze` | Short-form deconstruction — narrative structure, emotion curves, hook breakdown |
| `story-short-scan` | `/story-short-scan` | Short-form trend scan — Zhihu Yanayan/Fanqie short-form trending data |

| `browser-cdp` | `/browser-cdp` | Browser control — CDP protocol for scraping with reusable login sessions |

Natural language also triggers: `帮我开书` ("help me start writing") → `story-long-write`, `这篇太AI了` ("this is too AI-ish") → `story-deslop`, `把我的书导进来` ("import my book") → `story-import`, `沈栀现在什么状态` ("what's Shen Zhi's current status") → `story-explorer`.

## Agent System

Writing skills internally coordinate 7 specialized agents:

| Agent | Model | Role |
|:------|:------|:-----|
| **story-architect** | Opus | Story architecture — genre positioning, outline structure, hook/twist design, emotion arcs |
| **character-designer** | Sonnet | Character design — profiles, voice, motivation chains, dialogue writing |
| **narrative-writer** | Sonnet | Narrative writer — prose writing, de-AI-ify, format compliance |
| **consistency-checker** | Haiku | Consistency check — fact conflict scanning, foreshadowing tracking, S1-S4 grading reports |
| **story-researcher** | Sonnet | Research — CDP search + full-text extraction, multi-source cross-verification, structured reference files |
| **story-explorer** | Haiku | Story query — read-only character/foreshadowing/setting/progress lookup, quick context loading |
| **chapter-extractor** | Haiku | Chapter extraction — summaries, plot points, character mentions, parallel deconstruction unit |

Agents load writing theory from `references/` on demand (character design, dialogue techniques, twist toolbox, etc. — 100+ methodology files), without reserving context window space.

## Automation Hooks

6 hooks deployed automatically by `/story-setup`:

| Hook | Trigger | Function |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|
| session-start.sh | Session start | Display branch, progress snapshot, deconstruction status |
| session-end.sh | Session end | Log session to `追踪/session-log.txt` |
| detect-story-gaps.sh | Session start | Detect setting gaps, missing outlines, foreshadowing breaks |
| pre-compact.sh | Before context compaction | Save progress snapshot path and line-count summary |
| post-compact.sh | After context compaction | Prompt to read progress snapshot for context recovery |
| validate-story-commit.sh | git commit | Check hardcoded attributes, setting required fields (warning only, non-blocking) |

## Project File Structure

A long-form novel can easily reach hundreds of thousands of words across hundreds of chapters. Setting conflicts, broken foreshadowing, timeline inconsistencies — relying on memory alone is a recipe for disaster.

The file system separates settings, outlines, prose, and tracking into independent dimensions. The conversation handles creation; the file system handles memory.

**Long-form:**

```
{Book Title}/
├── Settings/
│   ├── World/              # Background, power systems, etc. — one file per topic
│   ├── Characters/         # One file per character (Shen_Zhi.md, Lu_Yanzhi.md)
│   ├── Factions/           # One file per faction/organization (Tianji_Pavilion.md)
│   ├── Relationships.md    # Character relationship map
│   └── Genre_Positioning.md # Core trope + benchmark analysis
├── Outline/
│   ├── Outline.md          # Full-book volume-level structure
│   ├── Volume_1.md         # One per volume: payoff pacing + emotion arc + character arc + foreshadowing + twists
│   ├── Chapter_001.md      # One per chapter: events + hooks + payoffs + suspense
│   └── ...
├── Prose/
│   ├── Chapter_001_Title.md
│   └── ...
├── Benchmark/
│   └── {Benchmark Book}/
│       ├── Source/              # Benchmark book original chapters
│       └── Report.md            # Analyze skill output
├── Tracking/                # Continuity management
│   ├── Context.md           # Writing context (for compact recovery)
│   ├── Foreshadowing.md     # Foreshadowing planted/resolved status table
│   └── Timeline.md          # In-story timeline
├── References/              # story-researcher output
│   └── {topic}.md           # Split by research topic
```

**Deconstruction Library:** Deconstruction skills save outputs to `拆文库/{Book Title}/` at project root by default. Writing skills can directly reference `拆文报告.md` as benchmark material.

## Knowledge Base

Each skill includes a `references/` knowledge base loaded on demand to keep context lean.
